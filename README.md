  This should just contain what you need to access the source code and make changes to the original mod. You will have to put the Dialogue Views and Source Scripts in there proper place in the mod file downloaded from Nexus yourself.

  Know that this is my first time uploading things to git hub, I'm not a very experienced coder and I may be doing something wrong. Please feel free to tell me.
In regards to the SKSE Part, It seems like from looking at other pages, that I'm supposed to upload a cmake folder on top of the cmakelists and all that. No such folder is in my projects files, Idk where to get it, this is one of the things you should correct me on if you know.
Also I can see from other pages you are supposed to put your included header files in an Include folder? I didn't do that in my project folder so I didn't want to just do that here in case it messes things up/ makes things different.

  Lastly, Know that I had made a couple changes to the plugin.cpp since uploading, mostly to try adding other alphabets (specifically chines), I believe I reversed all the changes, but just know there might be some difference I missed.
